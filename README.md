# Transition Path Sampling with Diffusion Path Samplers
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2405.19961-84cc16)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19961)

3D videos of transition paths from our diffusion path sampler can be found in [project page](https://kiyoung98.github.io/tps-dps/)

## Installation
We provide a script for installing packages (assuming CUDA 11.x) 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Quickstart:
We provide independent codes `double-well.ipynb` for training diffusion path sampler to sample transition paths of a synthetic double-well system. 

## Steps to reproduce the results
We provide instructions to reproduce the results of aldp and train a new model. You can replace aldp with fast folding proteins: chignolin, trpcage, bba, bbl

- **Sampling**: Run the following command to sample transition paths.
    ```
    bash scripts/sample/aldp.sh
    ```
- **Evaluation**: Run the following command to evaluate sampled paths
    ```
    bash scripts/eval/aldp.sh
    ```
- **Training**: Run the following command to start training. For better results, try many seeds
    ```
    bash scripts/train/aldp.sh
    ```
